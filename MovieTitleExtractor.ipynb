    "When it comes to referring to objects and entities, most English sentences follow a similar structure.  There is a lot of success in named entity recognition when identifying locations, times, and people from text.  Less successful, however, is when we are dealing with names that are synonymous with common words.  Even moreso when the data we are dealing with informal data, such as tweets from Twitter.  This experiment aims to extract movie titles from Twitter data using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).  The main idea is that while every tweet is unique, a common sentence structure (part-of-speech tags) sequence can be learned from all of the tweets.\n",

Both datasets may contain tweets that do not refer a movie, but still contain a word that is synonymous with a movie.\n",

    "But what do these conditions mean?  Precision tells us the ratio of correctly guessed movies to correctly guessed movies and incorrectly guessed movies.  Recall tells us the ratio of correctly guessed movies to correctly guessed movies and incorrectly ignored movies.  F-measure is calculated by combining the precision and recall.  A high recall and low precision would yield the same F-measure as a high precision and a low recall would.\n",

    "This means that in test dataset 1 our algorithm thinks less correct movies are incorrect, but thinks too many incorrect movies are correct.  The result is different for test dataset 2: it thinks less incorrect movies are correct, but thinks too many correct movies are incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, it's difficult to know which of higher precision or higher recall is better.  We can obtain a higher recall score by accepting all candidate movies in our `test(test_data)` function.  This means that all candidate movies will be returned as \"guessed\" movies which brings our recall score much higher, but at the same time it means that it will return *every* movie that it sees, as long as the movie is in the gazetteer.  This isn't very wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, it does a pretty good job of actually extracting movies from the tweets as well as ignoring words that are synonymous with movie titles.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalized tweet:** #OhHeyGuys would you rather I tweet #AmericanHustle or #Hobbit tomorrow ?\n",

    "* **Actual movie**: \n",
    "* **Guessed movie:**\n",

    "The first example shows that our algorithm correctly extracts two movie titles from the tweet.  The second example shows that our algorithm is picks out the correct movie reference (\"hobbit\" and \"#Hobbit\" are in the gazetteer).  The third example shows that it doesn't consider #Hobbit to be a movie title.  While it is a movie title, the tweet refers to #Hobbit as a character, not the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest drawback to our algorithm is that it only finds movies that are in the gazetteer (ie. list of movie titles).  This means that without the gazetteer, it will not find any movies.  This is a problem because we would need to keep an updated list of movies and their varying reference phrases (e.g. Lord of the Rings, LOTR, LotR).  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalized tweet:** The Lego movie was hilarious ! Sweet too ! And Nandos was gorgeous ! #twopuddings Cody ;)\n",
    "* **Actual movie:** The Lego movie\n",
    "* **Guessed movies:** Lego movie, The Lego movie\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Lego movie\" and \"The Lego movie\" refer to the same movie, yet the program separates them because the two are separate entries in the gazetteer.  This is not optimal.  A post-processing step such as a gazetteer entry lookup function would solve this, but as stated before, requires an up-to-date list of variations of movie titles."
